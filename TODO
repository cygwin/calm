* The current update done by upset is atomic: It reads both uploads and release
  area and verifies the resulting package set is consistent before moving an
  ything.

  For simplicitly, this reimplmentation splits the moving and package set
  consistency check into separate pieces, but we should have the pieces to add
  that feature back.

* upset appears to have a feature intended to merge existing the requires: with
  those in setup.hint.  I'm not sure if it works, though.  Something like that
  would be quite useful, though, telling you when dependencies were added or
  removed.
