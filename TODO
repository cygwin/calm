* more than 2 versions possible
* run more often, option to not do anything if no uploads (to avoid reading the release area if we don't need to), lockfile to avoid colliding runs
* use irkerd to report when calm failed due to an error?
* upload a hash at the same time as package, and pass that through to setup.ini
* mksetupini should have an okmissing option for override.hint which names non-existent versions
* use ./setup.hint inside the tar file, avoiding all the hint/tar coherence problems
* mksetupini should write to stdout if --inifile not specified
